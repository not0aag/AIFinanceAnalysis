## How The Code Works (The Simple Version)

Think of this app like a well-organized house with different rooms for different purposes:

### The House Structure (`src/` folder):

#### Front Door (`app/` folder):
- **`layout.tsx`** - The main frame of your house (header, navigation)
- **`page.tsx`** - The welcome mat (what you see first)
- **`globals.css`** - The interior design (colors, fonts, spacing)

#### Living Rooms (`components/` folder):
Each component is like a piece of furniture with a specific job:

- **`Header.tsx`** - The smart home controller (navigation, search, theme switching)
- **`Sidebar.tsx`** - The remote control rack (quick access to different sections)
- **`Logo.tsx`** - The family photo (your app's identity)
- **`ClientLayout.tsx`** - The room organizer (manages theme and layout)

#### Finance Rooms (`components/budgets/`, `components/transactions/`):
- **`BudgetCreator.tsx`** - Your financial planning desk
- **`BudgetCard.tsx`** - Individual budget folders on your desk
- **`TransactionForm.tsx`** - Your expense notebook
- **`TransactionFilters.tsx`** - Your filing system organizer

#### Analytics Room (`components/analytics/`):
- **`SpendingChart.tsx`** - Your financial dashboard (like a car's speedometer)
- **`CategoryBreakdown.tsx`** - Pie charts showing where money goes
- **`TrendAnalysis.tsx`** - Your financial weather forecast

#### Utility Closet (`lib/` folder):
- **`utils.ts`** - The toolbox (helper functions)
- **`finance-utils.ts`** - Financial calculator
- **`analytics.ts`** - Data analyzer
- **`openai.ts`** - AI brain connector

## Design Philosophy

### Apple-Inspired Design:
We borrowed design principles from Apple because they make things that just *feel* good to use:
- **Clean lines** - No clutter, just what you need
- **Beautiful colors** - Easy on the eyes in both light and dark mode
- **Smooth animations** - Everything flows naturally
- **Thoughtful spacing** - Comfortable to look at and use

### Color System:
```css
/* Light Mode - Like a bright, airy office */
--color-background: #ffffff (clean white)
--color-text-primary: #1d1d1f (readable dark text)
--color-surface: #f5f5f7 (subtle gray backgrounds)

/* Dark Mode - Like a cozy evening setup */
--color-background: #000000 (deep black)
--color-text-primary: #f5f5f7 (soft white text)
--color-surface: #0a0a0a (elevated surfaces)
```

## Key Components Explained

### Budget System:
```typescript

interface Budget {
  id: string
  name: string        // "Groceries", "Entertainment", etc.
  amount: number      // How much you planned to spend
  category: string    // What type of expense
  period: string      // "monthly", "yearly"
  spent: number       // How much you've actually spent
}
```

### Transaction Tracking:
```typescript
// How we track your money
interface Transaction {
  id: string
  date: string        // When it happened
  amount: number      // How much (negative for expenses)
  description: string // "Coffee at Starbucks"
  category: string    // "Food & Dining"
  type: 'income' | 'expense'
}
```

## Theme System

### How Theme Switching Works:
The app watches your preference and automatically adjusts everything:

1. **System Detection** - Checks if you prefer light or dark mode
2. **Manual Override** - You can choose your own preference
3. **Instant Application** - Everything changes smoothly
4. **Persistence** - Remembers your choice for next time

```css
/* The magic happens with CSS variables */
.theme-light {
  --background: white;
  --text: black;
}

.theme-dark {
  --background: black;
  --text: white;
}
```
