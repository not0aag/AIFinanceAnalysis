# Logo Integration Documentation

## Overview

The Finance AI logo has been successfully integrated into the application's key UI components using the existing logo.svg file located at `public/images/logo.svg`.

## Implementation

### Logo Component (`src/components/Logo.tsx`)

A flexible, reusable logo component with the following features:

- **Size options**: `small` (32px), `medium` (48px), `large` (72px)
- **Text toggle**: Option to show/hide "Finance AI" text
- **Styling**: Gradient background with white logo image
- **Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes

### Integration Points

1. **Login Page** (`src/app/login/page.tsx`)

   - Large logo without text in the header
   - Creates a professional, branded login experience
   - Logo is prominently displayed above the form

2. **Sidebar** (`src/components/Sidebar.tsx`)

   - Medium logo with text in the main sidebar
   - Consistent branding across the dashboard
   - Uses the modern sidebar layout

3. **Dashboard Layout** (`src/app/(dashboard)/layout-client.tsx`)
   - Medium logo with text in the alternative layout
   - Ensures consistency across different layout approaches

## Usage Examples

```tsx
// Large logo without text (login page)
<Logo size="large" showText={false} />

// Medium logo with text (sidebar)
<Logo size="medium" showText={true} />

// Small logo only (compact spaces)
<Logo size="small" showText={false} />
```

## Styling Features

- **Gradient Background**: Green to blue gradient container
- **White Logo**: SVG logo is filtered to white for contrast
- **Text Gradient**: "Finance AI" text uses gradient from primary to green
- **Responsive Shadow**: Different shadow sizes based on logo size
- **Consistent Spacing**: Uses CSS custom properties for spacing

## Files Modified

- ✅ `src/components/Logo.tsx` - Enhanced with flexible props
- ✅ `src/app/login/page.tsx` - Added large logo to header
- ✅ `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` - Added medium logo with text
- ✅ `src/app/(dashboard)/layout-client.tsx` - Added medium logo with text

## Visual Result

- **Login Page**: Professional branded entry point with prominent logo
- **Sidebar**: Consistent brand presence in navigation
- **Dashboard**: Logo visible in all dashboard views for brand recognition

The logo integration provides a cohesive, professional appearance throughout the application while maintaining design consistency and visual hierarchy.
