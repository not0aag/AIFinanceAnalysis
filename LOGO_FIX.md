# Logo Image Loading Fix

## Issue Identified

The logo was not loading because:

1. **Wrong file extension**: Code was looking for `logo.svg` but the actual file is `logo.png`
2. **Missing error handling**: No fallback when image fails to load

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Corrected File Path

- ✅ Changed from `/images/logo.svg` to `/images/logo.png`
- ✅ Verified file exists at `public/images/logo.png`

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling

- ✅ Added `useState` for error tracking
- ✅ Added `useEffect` to test image loading
- ✅ Added graceful fallback to 💰 emoji icon
- ✅ Added console logging for debugging

### 3. Improved Image Component

- ✅ Added `objectFit: 'contain'` for better scaling
- ✅ Added proper width/height containers
- ✅ Added loading state management
- ✅ Added error callbacks

### 4. Debug Tools Added

- ✅ Created `LogoDebug.tsx` component for testing
- ✅ Tests both regular `<img>` and Next.js `<Image>` components
- ✅ Temporarily added to login page for verification

## Expected Results

1. **If logo.png loads**: Beautiful gradient container with the actual logo image
2. **If logo.png fails**: Graceful fallback to 💰 emoji with same styling
3. **Console logs**: Clear debugging information about loading status

## How to Test

1. Open the login page in browser
2. Check browser console for logo loading messages:
   - ✅ "Logo image found and loaded" = Success
   - ❌ "Logo image not found at /images/logo.png" = File issue
3. Look at the debug section at bottom of login page for additional tests

## Next Steps

1. Test the page and check console messages
2. If working correctly, remove the debug component
3. The logo should now display properly in:
   - Login page header (large size)
   - Sidebar navigation (medium size)
   - Dashboard layout (medium size)

## Fallback Strategy

Even if the PNG file has issues, the component now gracefully falls back to a 💰 emoji icon with the same beautiful gradient styling, ensuring the UI never breaks.
